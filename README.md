# 🚍 AutoArkive – Car Dealership Management System
AutoArkive is a proposed ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application aimed at transforming inventory management for used car dealerships. Many dealerships still depend on spreadsheets and handwritten records—methods that are slow, prone to errors, and limit operational efficiency. AutoArkive will address these challenges by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform where dealers can manage vehicle listings, maintain key information such as prices, specifications, and images, and generate meaningful reports for better decision-making. Built using the modern and high-performance ASP.NET Core framework with Razor Pages, the system will deliver improved scalability, security, and responsiveness—ultimately enabling dealerships to streamline operations, reduce mistakes, and maximize profitability.
